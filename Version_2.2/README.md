Low Scale Prototype/Pre-Production Version. Minor hardware changes to occur as software dictates.

Adding the ability to connect main RS-485 tx/rx to either UART4 or PRU1_UART0. The PRU UART0 would be good to offload communication overhead of token-based network protocols from the main processor. Cleaning up layout and power planes for improved signal integrity.
