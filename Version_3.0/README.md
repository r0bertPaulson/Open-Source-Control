New Modular Board which allows the creation of a family of devices to cover most Building Automation control use cases. 

This board will have headers that can connect to an add-on sub-board and other devices that are application specific.

For example, by adding an airflow sensor and two analog actuator outputs, you will have a device that can control a VAV (Variable Air Volume) terminal unit specifically.
